import type { DevicePosture } from '@tapflowio/protocol'

/**
 * The postures tapflow can actually put an emulator into, in the order the protocol requires:
 * **most closed → most open**.
 *
 * **Two vocabularies, and only one of them can fold anything.** The guest lists what it supports
 * through `cmd device_state print-states` — `CLOSED(0)`, `HALF_OPENED(1)`, `OPENED(2)`,
 * `REAR_DISPLAY_MODE(3)` on a Pixel 9 Pro Fold. The *emulator* takes `adb emu posture` with its own
 * numbering (1 closed, 2 half-opened, 3 opened, 4 flipped, 5 tent). Writing the guest's state moves
 * the framework and leaves the emulator rendering the screen it had, so this table is keyed by the
 * guest's name and carries the emulator's id, and `id` on the wire is the emulator's.
 *
 * **Two of the guest's four are deliberately absent, for the same reason twice: a control that
 * changes nothing is worse than no control.**
 *
 * `REAR_DISPLAY_MODE` has no `adb emu posture` equivalent, so tapflow cannot reach it at all.
 *
 * `OPENED` can be reached and presents **the same 2076x2152 screen as `HALF_OPENED`** — measured on
 * a Pixel 9 Pro Fold, where `emu posture 2` and `emu posture 3` differ only in what the guest calls
 * the state. Offering both put a step in the control that visibly did nothing, which read as a
 * press that had been dropped. So the unfolded screen is offered once, under the label a person
 * would look for, and `HALF_OPENED` is the id that reaches it because the two are indistinguishable
 * on screen. An app that branches on the *guest's* posture would want the distinction back; nothing
 * tapflow shows today can express it.
 *
 * A guest posture with no entry here is dropped rather than falling through to a title-cased
 * label — appearing as a button that does nothing is the failure this table exists to prevent.
 *
 * The labels are what a person reads. The raw tokens are not — nobody should see
 * `REAR_DISPLAY_MODE` in a UI, and a viewer that had to map them would need a case per platform,
 * which is what `AgentRegistry` exists to avoid.
