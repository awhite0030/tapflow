 * Which releases of an app's list are open — remembered per app, in this browser.

 * **Only what the person toggled is stored.** A release nobody touched follows the default, the
 * newest open and the rest closed, so a version uploaded since the last visit arrives open while one
 * deliberately collapsed stays collapsed. Storing the whole open set instead would have shown every
 * new upload closed — the version a person most often comes to look at.
 *
 * **Derived during render, not seeded by an effect** (#834). The seed ran after the commit that
 * showed the list, so when a retry brought the list back and focus moved to the first release
 * header, that header was announced collapsed and then reported its own expansion.
 *
 * `appId` is the app whose rows are on screen, which during an app switch is still the previous one.
 * "Newest" is the first release *of the list shown*, so under a search or filter it is the newest
 * that matches — the one a person narrowing the list is most likely after. When a status change
 * takes the newest release's last matching row away, the next one opens in the same commit, which
 * is also where focus goes (#833).
