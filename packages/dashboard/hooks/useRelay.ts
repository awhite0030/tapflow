/**
 * Who this tab is, for the relay's ownership check. One value for the whole document, so the four sockets
 * this app opens (`SessionList`, `DeviceViewer`, `useAgentSession`, `MacResources`) are one holder — which
 * is what lets the unmount teardown shut down a device the viewer's socket was holding.
 *
 * **In memory, deliberately not `sessionStorage`.** That store is *copied* into a tab opened from this one
 * — duplicate tab, ⌘-click on a same-origin link, session restore — so two tabs would share an identity
 * and the second would silently take the first's device. A per-document value has no such twin: a new
 * document is a new tab is a new identity.
 *
 * It survives what it needs to. The reconnect below runs inside this document, so a Wi-Fi blip returns as
 * the same client and re-joins its own session instead of waiting out the relay's occupancy window. A
 * *reload* is a new document and a new identity, which is correct for a duplicate and costs a reloading
 * tester nothing in the ordinary case — the socket closes cleanly, so the relay releases the session. The
 * exception is a reload *during* a blip: no clean close, new identity, so the relay's window applies.
 *
 * **`newRequestId`, not `crypto.randomUUID`.** The latter is secure-context only and a LAN deployment is
 * plain HTTP — the primary manual-testing path. This module is loaded by every route, so a throw here is
 * a blank page rather than a broken socket, and it would have looked correct in dev (localhost is a secure
 * context) and in vitest (jsdom is not a browser). `lib/requestId.ts` records this exact lesson from the
 * last time; this is the third caller it warned about.
