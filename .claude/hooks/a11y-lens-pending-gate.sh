# Stop: if an a11y-lens pre-commit check was skipped and its files are still unreviewed, block
# finishing once and ask for `a11y-lens check --pending`.
#
# **Why a gate at all.** The pre-commit job never blocks on its own infrastructure — a timeout, an
# agent error, unparseable output, a file dropped for the prompt budget — so it exits 0 and lefthook
# prints the same ✔️ as a clean run (#827). a11y-lens records those files under the git common dir,
# and this is where somebody finally hears about it: an agent session usually ends right after its
# last commit, before any later commit could print the CLI's own warning.
#
# **Satisfied inside the session, not only by the files.** Stop fires at the end of every turn, and
# `--pending` is the same agent call that just failed; if it fails again the files stay, and a gate
# that looked only at them would block every turn after. So a `--pending` run in this session's
# transcript passes, the way one `/ai-tells` run passes `docs-aitells-gate.sh` — **but only for what
# was recorded before it.** A skip later in the same session writes a newer file and blocks again;
# a failed `--pending` rewrites nothing, so it does not.
#
# **Reads the layout, not the records.** a11y-lens documents `<git-common-dir>/a11y-lens/pending/
# *.json` as a public contract; counting files there needs no schema. The test builds its fixture
# with the installed CLI rather than by hand, so a layout change in an upgrade fails it instead of
# turning this gate silently off.
#
# English, because `.claude/` is committed and a contributor's agent reads it.
