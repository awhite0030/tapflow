// `mcp-server` and `flow-runner` both decorate a session-scoped failure with what the relay has told them
// about that session — `failed()` appends `sessionNote(sessionId)`, so a caller reading "No booted device"
// also learns that the agent reconnected and cleared its binding. The mechanism is shared, so the risk is
// not that it breaks: it is that **one call site stops using it and nothing says so** (#546).
//
// Three anchors were designed and two were broken before this one, and each failure is worth keeping,
// because each is the obvious idea:
//
//  - **Anchor on `throw`.** Misses the sites with the most leverage. `waitFor`'s deadline and the socket's
//    close handler both `reject` from inside a closure, and deleting `sessionNote` from the first removes
//    the cause from *every* waiter's timeout in that file. Neither is a `throw`, and neither closure's
//    enclosing function takes a `sessionId` to key on.
//  - **Allow-list by error class.** Fails open. `PlatformError` is `flow-runner`'s general class, so
//    admitting it passes `queryUITree`'s note-carrying throw *and* the bare `screenshot` one this program
//    had to fix — the two look identical from the class.
//  - **Exempt a method by name.** Fails open more widely. Exempting `awaitInputAck` also exempts the
//    ordinary `failed()` throw inside it — the one #457 exists for.
//
// So the anchor is **construction**, and the judgement is whether the expression reaches a cause path.
// That covers `throw`, `reject`, closures and helpers at once.
//
// Scope is still needed — `send()` and `listBuilds()` construct bare errors and there is no session to
// name — but it is read from the **method body's text**, not its signature. That is the distinction the
// signature could not make: `waitFor` takes `sessionId` as an *optional* parameter and rejects from a
// closure, while `connect()` takes nothing and reaches a session through `w.sessionId`. Both are
// session-scoped; only one says so in its parameters.
//
// **This is a floor, and here is exactly where it stops.** Scope and cause are both read from the
// *innermost enclosing function*, which is coarse in one direction: a function that consults the record
// anywhere before a construction passes every construction after it. Three functions have more than one
// cause call and are therefore only weakly held — both `awaitInputAck`s and `flow-runner`'s `queryUITree`.
// Everything else in these two files has exactly one, so reverting it is caught. Measured that way rather
// than asserted: the four sites this change fixed are each the only cause call in their function. And the
// coarseness is narrowed from the other side — the constructed message must **interpolate** something, so
// a function that reads the record and then throws a constant does not pass on the strength of the read.
//
// One function defeats even that, and it has its own test below: `awaitInputAck` reads `lifecycle` to decide
// whether the optimistic path may run, which is a different question from what its message says. Review
// measured the note being deleted from it while this rule stayed green.
//
// It also cannot see provenance. `new Error(this.sessionNote(id) ? 'x' : 'x')` satisfies it while saying
// nothing. What it holds is the **reversion** — someone deleting the note from a site that had it — which
// is what #546 was filed about.
