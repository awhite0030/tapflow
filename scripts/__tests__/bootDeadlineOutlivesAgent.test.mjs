// **A client that gives up before the agent does replaces a reason with a bare timeout.** The agents poll
// for a booting device — 90s on iOS, 120s on Android — and then answer `device:boot-error` with what went
// wrong. `mcp-server` waited 30s, *inside* both, so a cold boot past 30 seconds reported a timeout to the
// model while the boot was proceeding normally and its explanation was already on its way (#549).
//
// The two numbers live in different packages and neither imports the other, so nothing could hold them
// together. That is what this file is: not a check that a constant has a particular value — anyone may
// change any of them — but that the relationship between them survives the change.
//
// **The margin is the part that is easy to get wrong, and it is why this is not a bare `<`.** Those agent
// constants bound *one poll*, not the request. A boot also lists devices, may shut the device down and
// erase it, boots it, opens a stream — none of which has a named ceiling anywhere. `flow-runner` sat at
// exactly Android's 120s, which passes an inequality that reads `deadline > ceiling` only if you squint,
// and buys zero room for any of those stages. So the check requires room, and names how much.
