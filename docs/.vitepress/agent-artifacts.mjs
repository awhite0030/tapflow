// What an LLM agent gets when it reads tapflow.dev.
//
// Measured on 2026-09-18 against the live site: `/llms.txt` answered 200, but every link in it
// pointed at a page that exists only as HTML, and `/llms-full.txt` was a 404. So the index worked
// and nothing it indexed did — an agent following a link had to strip VitePress's nav, sidebar and
// theme scripts back off to reach the prose. This hook closes that: the source markdown ships
// beside the HTML, and the English prose also ships as one file.
//
// **Written in `.mjs`, not `.ts`, so the root scripts suite can import it.** The hook's real
// operation is writing files, and `scripts/__tests__/agentReadableDocs.test.mjs` runs it against a
// temporary directory rather than asserting on a config literal. Nothing in CI builds the docs
// (`.github/workflows/` has no `docs:build`), so a test that needed a real build would not run at
// all.
